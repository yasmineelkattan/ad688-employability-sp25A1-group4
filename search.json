    "text": "Research Rationale\nRecent studies indicate that AI is transforming the job market by automating roles in manufacturing, customer service, and administrative work, leading to job displacement. At the same time, it is driving demand for skilled professionals in AI development, cybersecurity, and data analysis, creating new career opportunities(Perrault and Clark ((2024))). As AI continues to evolve, workers will need to adapt by developing new skills, making AI-focused education and training increasingly essential. Although AI will displace certain tasks in manufacturing and administrative work it will also lead to the evolution of existing jobs. This has been something that has happened in the past with the evolution of technology and although it led to job displacement it also led to revolutionary strides in the efficiency of work. This in turn leads to economic and job growth which the masses should welcome and not turn away from (George ((2024))). Further not all jobs are replaceable, but they would greatly benefit from shifting to include some level of AI including supply chain, medicine, and manufacturing. With the correct training the transition to include AI will be critical to the shift the world will see as a result. This research aims to explore how AI is reshaping employment, balancing job losses with new job creation. The findings will provide valuable insights for businesses, policymakers, and workers, helping them navigate Al-driven changes and prepare for the future workforce."

    "text": "Brief Literature Review\nExisting research highlights the growing divide between AI-driven careers and traditional industries.\nPerrault and Clark ((2024)) In 2023, AI-related job postings accounted for 1.6% of all listings in the United States from 2.8% in 2022, This decline is linked to fewer openings from top Al firms and aCOwn.reduced emphasis on tech roles within these companies.\nGeorge ((2024)) The world has had multiple market evolutions including the Industrial Revolution which led to shifts in the machinery used and decreased the need for as many employees working in the fields. The number of employees working in agriculture decreased from 70% of the developed world in the mid-19th cenutry to 2-3% today. This led to an increase in people working in manufacturing to maintain the technology used in agriculture. The world would likely see a similar outcome once AI starts to present in more industries."

Load the CSV file into a pandas dataframe.\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/lightcast_job_postings.csv')\n\nThen, we carry out some data cleaning steps to remove unrelated items and properly deal with replace missing data. Here, we focus on full-time in-office non-internship roles.\n\n# remove duplicated rows\ndf = df.drop_duplicates(subset='ID')\n\n# convert date columns to datetime format\ndf['LAST_UPDATED_DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df['LAST_UPDATED_DATE'])\ndf['LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP'] = pd.to_datetime(df['LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP'])\ndf['POSTED'] = pd.to_datetime(df['POSTED'])\ndf['EXPIRED'] = pd.to_datetime(df['EXPIRED'])\n\n# remove internship\ndf = df[df['IS_INTERNSHIP'] == False]\n\n# remove non-full time jobs\ndf = df[df['EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_NAME'] == 'Full-time (&gt; 32 hours)']\n\n# remove remote/hybrid jobs, we want to focus on in-person jobs\ndf = df[df['REMOTE_TYPE_NAME'] == '[None]']\n\n# missing salary data\ndf['SALARY'] = df['SALARY'].fillna((df['SALARY_FROM'] + df['SALARY_TO']) / 2)  # mean if lower/upper bound avaiable\ndf['SALARY'] = df['SALARY'].fillna(df['SALARY_FROM'])  # loewr bound if no upper bound presented\ndf['SALARY'] = df['SALARY'].fillna(df['SALARY_TO'])  # upper bound if no lower bound presented\n\n\n\nIdentifying AI and Non-AI Jobs\nWe identify AI/non-AI jobs by keyword searching.\n\nkeywords = ['AI', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning',\n            'Data Science', 'Data Analysis', 'Data Analyst', 'Data Analytics',\n            'LLM', 'Language Model', 'NLP', 'Natural Language Processing',\n            'Computer Vision']\n\nmatch = lambda col: df[col].str.contains('|'.join(keywords), case=False, na=False)\n\ndf['AI_JOB'] = match('TITLE_NAME') \\\n             | match('SKILLS_NAME') \\\n             | match('SPECIALIZED_SKILLS_NAME') \\\n             | match('LIGHTCAST_SECTORS_NAME')\n\n\n\nTrend 1: AI vs. Non-AI Job Across Industries\nWe first compare the number of AI and Non-AI jobs across all industries.\n\ndf_grouped = df.groupby(['AI_JOB', 'NAICS2_NAME']).size().reset_index(name='Job_Count')\n\npx.bar(df_grouped, x='NAICS2_NAME', y='Job_Count', color='AI_JOB',\n       title=\"AI vs. Non-AI Job Distribution Across Industries\",\n       labels={'NAICS2_NAME': 'Industry', 'Job_Count': 'Number of Jobs'},\n       barmode='group')\n\n                                                \n\n\nAs we can see, there are almost always more AI jobs than non-AI jobs.\n\n\nTrend 2: AI-driven Job Growth vs. Job Displacement\nNow we turn out eyes to job growth and job displacement.\n\ndf_grouped = df.groupby(['POSTED', 'AI_JOB']).size().reset_index(name='Job_Count')\n\npx.line(df_grouped, x='POSTED', y='Job_Count', color='AI_JOB',\n        title=\"AI vs. Non-AI Job Posted Over Time\",\n        labels={'POSTED_MONTH': 'Month', 'Job_Count': 'Number of Job Postings'},\n        markers=True)\n\n/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/_plotly_utils/basevalidators.py:105: FutureWarning:\n\nThe behavior of DatetimeProperties.to_pydatetime is deprecated, in a future version this will return a Series containing python datetime objects instead of an ndarray.

In other words, AI related industry demands more junior roles and less senior roles compared to the traditional industry\n\n\nTrend 3: Skill in AI Roles vs. Traditional Roles\nAs we have seen, nearly every industry now requires a significant number of AI roles. One might interest in what are the valuable skills workers should develop to land in an AI job?\n\nimport ast\ndf['SKILLS'] = df['SKILLS_NAME'].apply(ast.literal_eval)\n\nai_skills = df[df['AI_JOB']]['SKILLS'].explode().value_counts().head(20).reset_index()\nai_skills.columns = ['Skill', 'Count']\n\nfig = px.bar(ai_skills, x='Skill', y='Count',\n             title=\"Top AI Job Skills\",\n             labels={'Skill': 'Skill Name', 'Count': 'Frequency'},\n             color='Skill')\nfig.show()\n\ntraditional_skills = df[~df['AI_JOB']]['SKILLS'].explode().value_counts().head(20).reset_index()\ntraditional_skills.columns = ['Skill', 'Count']\n\nfig = px.bar(traditional_skills, x='Skill', y='Count',\n             title=\"Top Traditional Job Skills\",\n             labels={'Skill': 'Skill Name', 'Count': 'Frequency'},\n             color='Skill')\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\n                                                \n\n\nAs we can see, data sciene skills e.g. (SQL, data analysis, and programming) are favorable in AI related jobs. In the contrary, traditional jobs value candidates with strong communication and management skills.\n\n\nTrend 4: Emerging AI Job\nWhile many traditional jobs are in the process of adopting AI-related technologies. There are many AI jobs emerging.\nWe note that Data Analyst is the fastest growing AI job.\n\njob_titles = df[df['AI_JOB']]['TITLE_NAME'].value_counts().head(20).reset_index()\njob_titles.columns = ['Job_Title', 'Count']\n\npx.bar(job_titles, x='Job_Title', y='Count',\n       title=\"Top Emerging AI Job Titles\",\n       labels={'Job_Title': 'Job Title', 'Count': 'Frequency'},\n       color='Job_Title')"
